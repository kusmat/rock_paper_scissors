This is a program to play the game: Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard

Rules of the game are:
    
- Spock beats scissors and rock, but loses to paper and lizard.
- Lizard beats Spock and paper, but loses to rock and scissors.
- Rock beats scissors and lizard, but loses to paper and Spock.
- Paper beats rock and Spock, but loses to scissors and lizard.
- Scissors beats paper and lizard, but loses to rock and Spock.

The program will have two players and each of them produce a random outcome, i.e., Rock, paper, scissor, spock, or lizard. 

Random number generator will select options:
    1 - Spock
    2 - Lizard
    3 - Rock
    4 - Paper
    5 - Scissors

Based on each playerâ€™s outcome, winner is determined.

You will see current score after each round, and score will be summed up if you decide to play more rounds.
You will have option to replay the game as many times as you want.
